            "response of plates to a decaying and convecting randon pressure field . following the methods of lyon, an analysis of the vibratory response of a plate to a random pressure field is given . the pressure correlation of the random field is assumed to have a scale small compared to the plate size, to decay exponentially, and to convect with constant speed over the plate . two cases are considered, one in which the convection speed is much less than the speed of free flexural waves in the plate, the other in which the convection speed is the same order as the flexural wave speed . the mean square plate displacement is shown to be relatively independent of convection for speeds much less than the flexural wave speed, and to increase significantly for speeds in the order of the flexural wave speed . it is shown that damping is usually, but not always, an effective means of vibration reduction . in the case of convection speeds much smaller than the flexural speed, the use of hysteretic damping for reduction of the displacement response is shown to be limited by the decay of the assumed random pressure field . \n",
            "the laminar boundary layer equation: a method of solution by means of an automatic computer . a method, very suitable for use with an automatic computer, of solving the hartree-womersley approximation to the incompressible boundary-layer equation is developed . it is based on an iterative process and the choleski method of solving a simultaneous set of linear algebraic equations . the programming of this method for an automatic computer is discussed . tables of a solution of the boundary-layer equation in a region upstream of the separation point are given . in the upstream neighbourhood of separation this solution is compared with goldstein's asymptotic solution and the agreement is good . \n",
            "dynamics of a dissociating gas . this is a lucid introduction to the effects of dissociation in gas dynamics . the problem in view is that of air flow past a bluff body at speeds somewhat above 2 km sec . thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed,. theories of near equilibrium for transport properties and of large departures from equilibrium being promised in parts 2 and 3 . following a survey of the equilibrium statistical thermodynamics of a pure dissociating diatomic gas, a new model is introduced . this /ideal dissociating gas/ is characterized by only three constants, the characteristic temperature, density and internal energy for dissociation . physically, it may be regarded as having its vibrational modes always just half excited (so that at low temperatures the ratio of specific heats approaches 4 3 rather then 7 5) . thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas are derived, and the oblique shock wave relations deduced in the /strong-shock/ approximation (including an elegant relation between the principal curvatures of any bow shock and the subsequent vorticity) . useful relations are given for the isentropic changes that take place along streamlines between shocks . various of these results are applied to the problem typified by a sphere flying at high mach number . the newtonian impact theory and its empirical modification are dismissed as lacking theoretical basis, in favor of the limit for large values of both mach number and density ratio across the shock . it is suggested that the zero surface pressure sometimes predicted by the latter theory corresponds to separation not of the flow but of the shock wave from the surface . an estimate is given for the subsequent shape of the shock . finally, another approximation is applied to the region near the stagnation streamline . the fluid is assumed incompressible, but rotational in accord with the shock relations,. and it is shown that a spherical shock corresponds to a concentric spherical body . the resulting surface pressure is within 1 per cent of that predicted by freeman's second approximation based on the newtonian-plus-centrifugal solution (same j. 1 (1956), \n",
            "properties of the confluent hypergeometric function . he confluent hypergeometric functions have proved useful in many branches of physics . they have been used in such problems involving diffusion and sedimentation, as isotope separation and protein molecular weight determinations in the ultracentrifuge . the solution of the equation for the velocity distribution of electrons in high frequency gas discharges may frequently be expressed in terms of these functions . the high frequency breakdown electric field may then be predicted theoretically for gases by the use of such solutions together with kinetic theory . this report presents some of the properties of the confluent hypergeometric functions together with six-figure tables of the functions . \n",
            "the production of uniform shear flow in a wind tunnel . a nearly uniform shear flow was obtained in the working section of a wind tunnel by inserting a grid of parallel rods with varying spacing . the function of such a grid is to impose a resistance to the flow, so graded across the working section as to produce a linear variation in the total pressure at large distances downstream without introducing an appreciable gradient in static pressure near the grid . a method of calculating a suitable arrangement of the rods is described . although this method is strictly applicable only to weakly sheared flows, an experiment made with a grid designed for a shear parameter as large as 0.45 gave results in close agreement with the theory . there was no evidence from the experiment of any large-scale secondary flow accompanying the shear--a danger inherent in an empirical attempt to grade the resistance of the grid--nor was any tendency observed for the shear to decay with increasing distance from the grid . \n"
